# Amazon-Product-Reviw-and-Recommendation
###Our project aims to analyze Amazon product reviews using web scraping and machine learning algorithms coupled with Natural Language Processing (NLP). By scraping reviews from Amazon, we collect a large dataset 
  for analysis. Utilizing NLP techniques, we preprocess and extract valuable insights from the text data. Then, employing machine learning algorithms, we classify sentiments, extract key features, and predict trends 
   in product reviews. This comprehensive approach provides valuable insights for businesses to understand customer sentiments and improve product offerings
